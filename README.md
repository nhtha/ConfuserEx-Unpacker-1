# ConfuserEx-Unpacker
This will be another confuserex unpacker from me however this will be completely static and run off emulation, this means it will support alot more mods of confuserex and will handle 90% of confuserex features so far just cfg will be excluded as do not have time to work this out properly and get it stable (if someone wants to add it feel free) 

this will support x86 modes also 

the main focus of this will be 0.5.0 and above however i may add support for the control flow for versions below 

this will be a simple drag and drop tool and should clean any combination of confuserex, however if there are multiple protections together i cant guarentee it will work.

you may still prefer the dynamic mode of my other unpacker on my other github (cawk) as this may be more universal this is really a tool which is the same as my last one just more stable on static mode.

this wont be tested much at all so expect there to be bugs create a PROPER issue report including how to reproduce the issue rather than "it doesnt work on this file" and i will take a look if i dont deem the issue report sufficient i will just close it and not fix the bug.

it would be nice to get some assistance on this tool for stability and bug fixes but i predict that there will be little to no help from the public community
